        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-700">1.1 Direct Personal Information Collection by the App</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The <strong>Santa AI Camera</strong> app does not directly collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII) from users, such as name, email address, address, or payment information, for the purpose of using the Service. This Service does not have login or payment functionality.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-700">1.2 Camera and Storage Access Permissions</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">
            My Service requests specific permissions to your device for the purpose of photo capture and saving.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-2 mb-4 text-gray-600">
            <li>
                <strong>Camera Permission:</strong> This permission is used solely for the core function of the app, which is taking photos. I do not collect or transmit any image or video data captured through this function to any external server.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Storage Permission:</strong> This permission is used solely to save the photos you take locally onto your device (phone). I do not access any other files within your device storage.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-500 italic">
            If you refuse these permissions, you may still be able to use the app, but the photo capture and saving features may not function.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-700">1.3 Service Providers (Third-Party Services)</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">
            The Service uses third-party services ("Service Providers") that may collect and use information to provide and improve the functionality of the app. These Service Providers may collect information that could be used to identify you.

                I use Google AdMob to serve advertisements in order to keep the Service free. AdMob collects and uses information about your device and your use of the Service to serve personalized ads.

        <p class="mb-4">
            Whenever you use my Service and an error occurs (including through the use of third-party services), I collect data called <strong>Log Data</strong> on your device. This Log Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

        <p class="mb-4">
            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. My Service does not use "cookies" directly, but the third-party service providers (e.g., Google AdMob) I use may utilize them to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device through your device settings.

        <p class="mb-4">
            I value your trust in providing your information, thus I am striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
